# Solaredge optimizers node for Node-RED

This is a node for Node-RED to scrape optimizer data from your SolarEdge cloud. You'll need your login data (username, password) and your site ID.

## Installation

In your Node-RED directory:

```
npm install node-red-contrib-solaredge-optimizers
```

## Usage

The following data has to be provided in the node to access the optimizer data:
  * **Username**: Your username at https://monitoring.solaredge.com.
  * **Password**: The corresponding password
  * **Site ID**: The ID of your site.
  * **Time Interval**:
    * Daily: Data of the current day
    * Weekly: Data of the current/last week

Optional inputs are:
  * **Collect Additional Info**: Scrapes the monitoring page for additional info such as *description*, *type*, *serial number* and *manufacturer*.
  * **Format For InfluxDB**: Returns the data in a format so that it can be directly sent to an InfluxDB batch node from [node-red-contrib-influxdb](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-influxdb) (tested for InfluxDB 2.0)
  * **InfluxDB Measurement**: In case *Format for InfluxDB* is checked, the name of the measurement.


The node will return the power in Watt for each inverter, string and optimizer in 15 minute intervals for the selected time interval.
